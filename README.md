## About Me

Hi, I’m Abiodun. I'm a dedicated business & data professional with a strong foundation in Physics and Computer Simulations in Science. My academic journey, including a bachelor's degree in Physics and a master's in Computer simulations, has honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. I specialize in using data to uncover actionable insights and support data-driven decision-making.

I enjoy exploring diverse datasets, transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations, and creating interactive dashboards. I thrive on tackling real-world problems through data modelling and simulations. I’m passionate about delivering impactful insights that optimize business processes and strategies.


### [Coffee Sales Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/Coffee-Sales-EDA)
Analyzed coffee sales data to uncover key trends, evaluate product performance, and gain actionable insights to optimize sales strategies and enhance customer engagement.

### [HR Data Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/HR-Data-Analysis)
An interactive dashboard to analyze employee turnover, diversity metrics, and performance evaluations. This project showcases advanced visualization and data storytelling skills.

### [YouTube Data Cleaning](https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/youtube_data_cleaning)
This project cleans YouTube channel data by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. The final dataset is prepared for analysis and visualization.

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/customer-churn-prediction)
This project predicts customer churn by preprocessing customer data, addressing class imbalance, and applying machine learning techniques. The model, built using a Random Forest Classifier, identifies key factors influencing churn, enabling actionable insights and business recommendations.

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/creditcard))
This project predicts fraudulent credit card transactions by preprocessing transaction data, addressing the class imbalance and applying machine learning techniques. The model, built using the XGBoost classifier, effectively identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. Key performance metrics include a precision of ~0.88, a recall of 1.00, and an AUPRC of 1.00, indicating the model's high accuracy in detecting fraud.
