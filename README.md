# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis of Coffee Sales.

In this personal project, I analysed coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022, focusing on identifying key sales trends, understanding customer behaviour, and evaluating product performance. The primary objective is to gain actionable insights to improve business strategies, optimize sales, and enhance customer engagement.

•  Data was taken from Kaggle.
•  Data cleaning, visualization, and reporting were done using Microsoft Excel. 
•  Slicers and interactive dashboard track changes and individual performance for each product type. 
•  The project write-up is published on (https://github.com/abiodunadedokun/portfolio-projects).
